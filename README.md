# Random Forest Digit Classifier

Used sklearnâ€™s digits dataset and applied Random Forest on it  
split the data using train test split  

Also made a dataframe from digits and added the target column at the end  

# Accuracy came out to be: 0.9805555555555555  

Then used confusion matrix and seaborn heatmap to display the results 
Visuals help a lot, heatmap shows how well it predicted
